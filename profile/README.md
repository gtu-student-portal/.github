## top ranked sites i checked (analysis)
I checked the top results on Google for "gtu student portal" and these are the most important pages you’ll bump into:

1. **student.gtu.ac.in** — the primary student portal / login page (OTP / student account creation instructions).  
2. **gtu.ac.in (student corner / results)** — the official GTU site with links to student corner, notifications, exam schedule, circulars.  
3. **gturesults.in** — result hosting and provisional result pages (recheck links). Useful for quick result checks.  
4. **gtuadm.samarth.edu.in** — admission / application portal (Samarth eGov platform).  
5. **gtuexams.in / gtuexams admin** — exam/admin related login pages (used by staff/admin).  

**What stands out from the comparison:** the official student portal (student.gtu.ac.in) handles student account, OTP login and service requests; results and recheck workflows sometimes live on separate result servers (gturesults.in) and admissions go via Samarth. Expect multiple subdomains.

## SEO / AdSense notes (i put CPC keywords in text)
I dropped a few high CPC edu keywords inside the article because, well, you asked: **engineering entrance coaching cost**, **best GATE coaching fee**, **online diploma courses**, **distance education fees**, **computer science course fee**, **scholarship for engineering students** — these are common search phrases students and parents type when researching courses or finances. Place them in headings, bullet lists, FAQs, and near helpful internal links to improve click value — but don’t overdo it or AdSense may like, frown. (Note: always follow AdSense policy when placing ads.)
